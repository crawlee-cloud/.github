### 🚀 What is Crawlee Cloud?

Crawlee Cloud is a self-hosted platform that lets you run **Crawlee and Apify Actors** on your own infrastructure. We provide an open-source implementation of the Apify API, meaning you can point the official [Apify SDK](https://sdk.apify.com) at your own servers and everything just works.

- **🏠 Your Infrastructure:** Deploy on your own servers, cloud, or anywhere you like.
- **🔒 Complete Privacy:** Your data stays exactly where you want it.
- **⚡ SDK Compatible:** Works with your existing Actors without code changes.
